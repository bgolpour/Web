## Web Visualization Dashboard 


I created a visualization dashboard Website using visualizations I have created in a past project. 

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which I can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where I can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where I can view the data used to build them.

* The landing page containing:
 
* An explanation of the project.
 
* Links to each visualizations page.

* Four visualization pages, each with:
 
* A descriptive title and heading tag.
 
* The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
 
* A paragraph that describing the plot and its significance.

* A "Comparisons" page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page so I can easily visually compare them.

 
* Bootstrap grid is used for the visualizations.

 * "Data" page displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations, which it is a bootstrap table component.
